## üõ† **How Cloudbliss Works?**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Uploading Files**  
When a user uploads a file, Cloudbliss performs the following steps:  
1. **Pre-processing** ‚Äì The file metadata (name, size, type) is extracted and stored.  
2. **Encryption & Chunking**  
   - If the file is **‚â§512MB**, it is split into **10 encrypted parts**.  
   - If the file is **>512MB**, **RES54 intelligently splits** it based on **2^n exponent rules** for optimized storage and retrieval.  
3. **Parallel Uploading with RES54**  
   - Chunks are uploaded **simultaneously** across multiple storage nodes using **parallel transfer**.  
   - Each chunk is **stored separately** and mapped with a unique identifier.  
4. **Metadata Storage**  
   - The system **stores metadata** (file name, encryption keys, chunk locations) in the database for **quick access**.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Downloading & Retrieving Files**  
When a user **downloads a file**, Cloudbliss ensures ultra-fast and secure retrieval:  
1. **Request & Authentication**  
   - User sends a **download request** for a file.  
   - Cloudbliss verifies **ownership and access permissions**.  
2. **Parallel Chunk Retrieval**  
   - Cloudbliss **fetches all encrypted chunks simultaneously** from distributed storage nodes.  
   - RES54 ensures **no bottlenecks**, retrieving chunks in the most **efficient order**.  
3. **Reassembly & Decryption**  
   - Chunks are **merged back** into a single file.  
   - The encrypted chunks are **decrypted using the original encryption key** (only available to the user).  
4. **Final Delivery**  
   - The **original file is reconstructed** and provided to the user **instantly**.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **File Metadata Retrieval & Searching**  
Cloudbliss enables **instant file searches and metadata retrieval**:  
1. **Indexed Metadata** ‚Äì Every file‚Äôs metadata (size, name, format) is stored in a **highly optimized index**.  
2. **Optimized Query System** ‚Äì Users can search files **instantly** using keywords, filters, or date ranges.  
3. **Smart Previews** ‚Äì Before downloading, Cloudbliss generates **thumbnails & previews** for supported file types.  

---

## üì¶ **How Cloudbliss Stores Your Files?**  
Cloudbliss **does not rely on centralized storage solutions**. Instead, it **utilizes ultra-secure storage buckets** with intelligent data distribution, ensuring **speed, scalability, and maximum redundancy**.  

---

## üöÄ **Why Cloudbliss?**  
Cloudbliss is **not just another cloud storage service**. It is a **revolution**‚Äîoffering the **most advanced encryption, speed, and unlimited storage capabilities** in the world.

# CloudBliss API Documentation

CloudBliss provides a RESTful API for programmatic access to your cloud storage. This API allows you to upload, manage, and retrieve files securely.

## Base URL

```
https://aouqcwbdoyrccjcrhzzi.supabase.co/functions/v1/

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting an API Key

1. Log in to your CloudBliss account
2. Navigate to Developer API section
3. Click "Generate API Key"
4. Copy and securely store your API key

**Important:** API keys start with `cb_` and should be kept secure. Never expose them in client-side code.

## Rate Limits

- **100 requests per minute** per API key
- Rate limit headers are included in responses:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per minute
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when rate limit window resets

## API Endpoints

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep API keys secure**: Never commit API keys to version control or expose them in client-side code
2. **Use environment variables**: Store API keys in environment variables
3. **Rotate keys regularly**: Generate new API keys periodically and revoke old ones
4. **Use minimal scopes**: Only grant the permissions your application needs
5. **Monitor usage**: Check API request logs regularly for suspicious activity
