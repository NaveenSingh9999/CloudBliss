## üõ† **How Cloudbliss Works?**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Uploading Files**  
When a user uploads a file, Cloudbliss performs the following steps:  
1. **Pre-processing** ‚Äì The file metadata (name, size, type) is extracted and stored.  
2. **Encryption & Chunking**  
   - If the file is **‚â§512MB**, it is split into **10 encrypted parts**.  
   - If the file is **>512MB**, **RES54 intelligently splits** it based on **2^n exponent rules** for optimized storage and retrieval.  
3. **Parallel Uploading with RES54**  
   - Chunks are uploaded **simultaneously** across multiple storage nodes using **parallel transfer**.  
   - Each chunk is **stored separately** and mapped with a unique identifier.  
4. **Metadata Storage**  
   - The system **stores metadata** (file name, encryption keys, chunk locations) in the database for **quick access**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Downloading & Retrieving Files**  
When a user **downloads a file**, Cloudbliss ensures ultra-fast and secure retrieval:  
1. **Request & Authentication**  
   - User sends a **download request** for a file.  
   - Cloudbliss verifies **ownership and access permissions**.  
2. **Parallel Chunk Retrieval**  
   - Cloudbliss **fetches all encrypted chunks simultaneously** from distributed storage nodes.  
   - RES54 ensures **no bottlenecks**, retrieving chunks in the most **efficient order**.  
3. **Reassembly & Decryption**  
   - Chunks are **merged back** into a single file.  
   - The encrypted chunks are **decrypted using the original encryption key** (only available to the user).  
4. **Final Delivery**  
   - The **original file is reconstructed** and provided to the user **instantly**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **File Metadata Retrieval & Searching**  
Cloudbliss enables **instant file searches and metadata retrieval**:  
1. **Indexed Metadata** ‚Äì Every file‚Äôs metadata (size, name, format) is stored in a **highly optimized index**.  
2. **Optimized Query System** ‚Äì Users can search files **instantly** using keywords, filters, or date ranges.  
3. **Smart Previews** ‚Äì Before downloading, Cloudbliss generates **thumbnails & previews** for supported file types.
